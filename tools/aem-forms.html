            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Form Models and Data Binding</h2>
                <p>AEM Forms supports binding form fields to structured data using <strong>Form Data Models (FDMs)</strong>, <strong>XML Schema Definitions (XSDs)</strong>, or <strong>JSON Schemas</strong>. This allows developers to define how form inputs map to backend systems, enabling seamless data exchange.</p>
                <h3>XML/JSON Schema-Driven Forms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define reusable form structure via <code>.xsd</code> or <code>.json</code> schema files</li>
                    <li>Automatically generate fields based on the schema</li>
                    <li>Use schema-driven validation and constraints</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Binding Fields to Schema Elements</h3>
                <p>Each form field can be mapped to a corresponding element in the schema using the <strong>Bind Reference</strong> property in the form editor.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensures clean data mapping on submission</li>
                    <li>Supports complex nested objects and repeatable elements</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Form Data Models (FDM)</h3>
                <p>FDMs are AEM's way of abstracting backend data sources (REST, SOAP, Database, etc.) into a unified model for data binding.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create data models using the AEM FDM UI</li>
                    <li>Map form fields to services for <strong>read, write, submit, or fetch</strong></li>
                    <li>Supports rule-driven population and dynamic behavior</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Custom Data Models</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Custom Java services or REST endpoints can be registered and exposed to FDM</li>
                    <li>Enables highly dynamic data flows like fetching live prices, account info, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Submit Actions and Workflows</h2>
                <p>Once a form is filled out, AEM provides multiple options for handling submission. The system is extensible and allows for both built-in and custom actions.</p>
                <h3>Out-of-the-box Submit Actions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Email:</strong> Sends submitted data to specified email(s)</li>
                    <li><strong>REST Endpoint:</strong> Posts data to external REST APIs</li>
                    <li><strong>Form Data Model:</strong> Submits data to FDM-connected backend systems</li>
                    <li><strong>AEM Workflow:</strong> Triggers an AEM workflow with the form data</li>
                    <li><strong>Store Content:</strong> Persists submitted content into JCR</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Invoking AEM Workflows</h3>
                <p>Adaptive Forms can be configured to trigger workflows on submission. This is useful for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Approval chains (e.g., loan or job application)</li>
                    <li>Multi-level review processes</li>
                    <li>Document generation and archival</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Workflow models can access submitted data using <code>MetaDataMap</code> and process it with custom steps.</p>
                <h3>Writing Custom Submit Actions</h3>
                <p>If built-in handlers aren't enough, you can write your own Java-based submit actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement the <code>com.adobe.forms.common.service.FormsSubmitAction</code> interface</li>
                    <li>Register with proper OSGi configuration</li>
                    <li>Handle business logic such as validation, data transformation, or conditional routing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Custom submit handlers give you complete control over how the data is treated post-submission.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Form Data Model (FDM)</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Form Data Model (FDM)</strong> in AEM Forms enables seamless integration between Adaptive Forms and external data sources like REST APIs, SOAP web services, OData services, and databases (JDBC). It acts as a bridge for both reading and writing data in real time, making your forms dynamic and connected.</p>
                <h3>Overview of FDM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual interface for integrating form fields with backend services</li>
                    <li>Supports CRUD operations</li>
                    <li>Enables form field prefill, dynamic population, and post-submission data storage</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Supported Integrations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>REST:</strong> Connect to RESTful APIs with GET/POST operations</li>
                    <li><strong>SOAP:</strong> WSDL-based integration with enterprise systems</li>
                    <li><strong>OData:</strong> Useful for Microsoft systems like Dynamics 365</li>
                    <li><strong>JDBC:</strong> Directly connect to databases using SQL queries</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Creating FDMs in Touch UI</h3>
                <p>You can create a new Form Data Model by navigating to:</p>
                <pre>Tools → Forms → Data Integration → Create → Form Data Model</pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a data source type (REST, SOAP, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Define and test service operations</li>
                    <li>Group data models and endpoints under one model</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Mapping FDM to Form Fields</h3>
                <p>Once FDM is defined, form authors can bind fields to FDM operations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read Services:</strong> Used to prefill form fields</li>
                    <li><strong>Write Services:</strong> Used during form submission to post data</li>
                    <li><strong>Rules:</strong> Trigger FDM calls based on user interaction or input changes</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Document Services (Optional but Powerful)</h2>
                <p>AEM Forms includes powerful <strong>Document Services</strong> that let you generate, manipulate, and render PDFs on the server side. These features are crucial for regulated industries like banking, insurance, and government that need high-fidelity documents for compliance and archival.</p>
                <h3>Generate PDF (Static or Interactive)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use <strong>Form Templates</strong> or <strong>Document Templates</strong> to generate PDFs from submitted data</li>
                    <li>PDFs can be either interactive (fillable) or flat (non-editable)</li>
                    <li>Integration with Document of Record (DoR) templates to create branded, ready-to-archive PDFs</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Pre-populating PDFs with Form Data</h3>
                <p>Use XML or JSON data to pre-fill PDF templates before rendering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Useful for auto-generating contracts, statements, or policy documents</li>
                    <li>Pre-filled values can come from FDM or external APIs</li>
                    <li>Can be rendered on the server and sent via email or download</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Flatten PDFs after Submission</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flattening removes all interactivity, making the PDF read-only</li>
                    <li>Prevents tampering and ensures regulatory compliance</li>
                    <li>Can be done automatically as part of the submit workflow</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Server-side Document Assembly</h3>
                <p>Advanced workflows can assemble multiple fragments (e.g., form sections, dynamic content) into a single PDF called the <strong>Document of Record</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use XDP or Designer templates</li>
                    <li>Merge attachments, dynamic text, and images into final document</li>
                    <li>Store or send documents using workflow actions</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Document services typically require the AEM Forms add-on packages and may need integration with Adobe LiveCycle components or AEM Forms on JEE.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Prefill and Personalization</h2>
                <p>One of the key strengths of AEM Forms is its ability to deliver personalized and pre-filled forms based on the user context, session information, or external data sources. This leads to better user experience and reduced data entry effort.</p>
                <h3>Using ContextHub with Adaptive Forms</h3>
                <p><strong>ContextHub</strong> is Adobe's client-side context engine that stores and delivers contextual data about the user session. You can use it to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prefill Adaptive Form fields based on logged-in user attributes</li>
                    <li>Modify form visibility rules based on user segments (e.g., "existing customer" vs "new customer")</li>
                    <li>Support personalization in multi-step forms</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To enable ContextHub integration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure ContextHub is enabled in your site template/page</li>
                    <li>Create user segments and use them in rules within Adaptive Forms</li>
                    <li>Access ContextHub data using expression syntax like <code>guideBridge.resolveNode("path").value</code></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Autofill from User Profile Data</h3>
                <p>Logged-in user profile data can be fetched and prefilled into the form automatically using:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Profile information from <code>/home/users</code> or external IDP (SSO)</li>
                    <li>Custom Java classes (OSGi Services) that read user info and inject into fields via custom rules</li>
                    <li>GuideBridge API (e.g., <code>guideBridge.setFieldValue("email", user.email)</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Prefill via FDM or URL Parameters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FDM Binding:</strong> Use Form Data Model's Read Services to prefill data before form loads</li>
                    <li><strong>URL Parameters:</strong> Fields can also be prefilled by appending query params like <code>?firstName=John</code></li>

                <h2>Validations and Rules Editor</h2>
                <p>AEM Forms comes with a flexible validation framework powered by its intuitive <strong>Rules Editor</strong>. Validation ensures that submitted data is complete, correct, and matches expected patterns.</p>
                <h3>Out-of-the-Box Rules Editor</h3>
                <p>The visual Rules Editor allows authors to define logic like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Required field enforcement (e.g., Email must not be blank)</li>
                    <li>Pattern matching (e.g., mobile number should match <code>[0-9]{10}</code>)</li>
                    <li>Conditional visibility (e.g., show "Company Name" only if "Business" is selected)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rules can be created using a point-and-click interface—no coding required for simple logic.</p>
                <h3>Client-side vs. Server-side Validation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Client-side validation:</strong> Instant feedback, reduces server load, customizable via JavaScript</li>
                    <li><strong>Server-side validation:</strong> Critical for security and final validation; executed post submission</li>
                    <li>Both should be used together to ensure strong validation and a good UX</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Writing Custom Validation Scripts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can write JavaScript in the Rules Editor using <code>guideBridge</code> API</li>
                    <li>Example: <code>if (!value.includes("@")) { return "Invalid email"; }</code></li>
                    <li>Advanced validations can be written as OSGi services and invoked from the backend during submission</li>
                    <li>Use <code>FormValidator</code> interface (Java) for reusable server-side validation logic</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Always validate mandatory business fields server-side to avoid client-side tampering.</p>

                <h2>AEM Forms with Workflows</h2>
                <p>AEM Forms tightly integrates with AEM Workflows to allow automation of form-driven business processes such as approvals, reviews, and escalations.</p>
                <h3>Auto-Start Workflows from Form Submissions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the Submit Action settings of an Adaptive Form, select <strong>“AEM Workflow”</strong> as the submission type.</li>
                    <li>Specify the Workflow Model to be triggered (e.g., <code>approval-workflow</code>).</li>
                    <li>You can pass form field values into the workflow using payload metadata or transient variables.</li>
                    <li>Form data (e.g., XML, JSON, or attachments) is stored under <code>/content/usergenerated</code> and can be used in workflow steps.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Adding Approver and Review Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the <strong>Participant Step</strong> in your workflow to assign tasks to approvers (e.g., manager, HR, legal team).</li>
                    <li>Customize the workflow inbox view to show necessary form data.</li>
                    <li>You can configure dynamic approvers using workflow process steps and logic based on submitted form values.</li>
                    <li>Example: Route to <code>finance-group</code> if <code>amount &gt; 10,000</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Integration with AEM Inbox and Notifications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Approvers receive tasks in the <strong>AEM Inbox</strong> (accessible via <code>/aem/inbox</code>).</li>
                    <li>Custom email notifications can be triggered via workflow steps using <code>Email Notification Process</code>.</li>
                    <li>Admins can view task status, reassign, or terminate workflows via the Workflow Console.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Vacation request forms, onboarding workflows, change approval processes, etc.</p>

            <section class="card">
                <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
                <p>Ensuring that AEM Forms are secure is critical, especially when capturing sensitive data such as personal details, IDs, or financial information.</p>
                <h3>CAPTCHA Integration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>AEM Forms supports integration with <strong>Google reCAPTCHA</strong> (v2 and v3).</li>
                    <li>Add the CAPTCHA component from the AEM Forms component browser.</li>
                    <li>Configure site key and secret key via the <code>cloudconfig</code> dialog or OSGi console.</li>
                    <li>Helps prevent bot submissions and protects public forms.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>CSRF Token Handling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>AEM includes automatic CSRF protection for Adaptive Forms.</li>
                    <li>The token is injected into the form at runtime and verified on submission.</li>
                    <li>No extra configuration is needed unless you've overridden servlet filters.</li>
                    <li>If custom submit actions are used, ensure CSRF filters are respected in the POST logic.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Enabling SSL for Form Submission</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure all Adaptive Form URLs are served over <strong>HTTPS</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Configure your Dispatcher and Web Server (Apache/IIS) with SSL certificates.</li>
                    <li>Redirect all <code>http://</code> traffic to <code>https://</code> using the Dispatcher rewrite rules.</li>
                    <li>Form submissions containing sensitive data (like Aadhaar, PAN, etc.) must never go over HTTP.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Role-Based Form Access</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Restrict form access by configuring ACLs on the form path (<code>/content/forms/...</code>).</li>
                    <li>Use user groups and permissions to allow only specific users/roles to view/submit the form.</li>
                    <li>You can also implement visibility conditions using ContextHub or Profile attributes.</li>
                    <li>Examples: Show Employee Feedback Form only to "employee-group" or disable fields for guest users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always validate form data on the server side before processing, even if client-side validation is in place.</p>

                <h2>Headless Forms</h2>
                <p><strong>Headless Forms</strong> allow you to consume and submit AEM Forms from external applications (e.g., React, Angular, mobile apps) using APIs, without relying on the traditional HTML-based rendering.</p>
                <h3>Submitting via APIs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use AEM Forms' <code>/submit</code> endpoint to POST JSON data directly.</li>
                    <li>Endpoints follow the structure: <code>/content/forms/af/my-form/jcr:content/guideContainer.af.submit.json</code></li>
                    <li>Headers must include <code>CSRF token</code> and <code>Content-Type: application/json</code>.</li>
                    <li>Responses include success/failure messages and error field mapping.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>JSON Schema Forms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can design forms based on a <strong>JSON Schema</strong> that defines the structure and data types.</li>
                    <li>The schema is uploaded via the <strong>Data Model</strong> editor or bound directly to the form fields.</li>
                    <li>This enables API-driven forms that can dynamically change based on schema variations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Headless Rendering of Adaptive Forms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>AEM provides a Headless Adaptive Form rendering framework (AEM Forms App SDK).</li>
                    <li>You can render and submit forms in external apps using JSON output, rendered via your preferred frontend stack.</li>
                    <li>It supports dynamic behavior (rules), validation, and FDM-backed prefill – all without using the AEM UI.</li>
                    <li>Includes support for offline rendering (Progressive Web App scenarios).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Embedding a self-service onboarding form inside a React-based web portal using Headless AEM Forms.</p>

                    <li>Configure signer roles (e.g., applicant, manager) and assign fields accordingly.</li>
                    <li>The form can be routed to Adobe Sign after submission using submit actions or workflows.</li>
                    <li>Adobe Sign will handle the digital signature, document routing, and notifications.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tracking Signed Responses</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>After signing, documents are returned to AEM and stored (optionally) in the repository or sent over email.</li>
                    <li>Status can be tracked in the Adobe Sign dashboard or AEM inbox (if integrated via workflow).</li>
                    <li>Audit trails and timestamps of all signatures are captured automatically.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can use Adobe Sign for contracts, HR forms, onboarding agreements, etc., right from within your AEM workflows.</p>

                <h2>Debugging & Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>Like any development feature, Adaptive Forms and their services may run into issues. Proper debugging techniques can save hours of frustration.</p>
                <h3>Enabling Form Logs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enable debug logs in Felix Console for packages like:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>com.adobe.forms</code></li>
                        <li><code>com.adobe.aemds</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Monitor <code>error.log</code> and <code>request.log</code> while submitting forms.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Common Issues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submit button doesn't work? → Check if required fields are filled or submit action is properly configured.</li>

                    <li>Adobe Sign not triggering? → Verify credentials and cloud service setup.</li>
                    <li>Form doesn't render? → Ensure all dependencies (clientlibs, templates) are correctly deployed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Inspecting Bindings & Model Issues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use browser DevTools to inspect form field bindings.</li>
                    <li>Enable debugging in the Rule Editor to trace rule evaluation.</li>
                    <li>Check if schema fields are correctly mapped to input fields in the Adaptive Form structure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use <strong>Preview</strong> mode and <strong>Console logs</strong> extensively during development to validate field behavior and submission logic.</p>
