                <h2>Introduction to AEM Commerce</h2>
                <h3>What is AEM Commerce?</h3>
                <p>AEM Commerce refers to the integration of Adobe Experience Manager with e-commerce platforms to deliver personalized and content-rich shopping experiences. It allows marketers and merchandisers to blend content and commerce in a unified interface — combining storytelling with product data.</p>
                <h3>Headless vs. Integrated Commerce</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Headless Commerce:</strong> AEM acts as the front-end consuming APIs from a commerce engine (like Magento, SAP, etc.). Offers maximum flexibility and scalability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated Commerce:</strong> Tight coupling of AEM and commerce platform using connectors and APIs. Offers out-of-the-box templates, components, and product data integrations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Real-world Use Cases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating immersive product landing pages with editorial content and dynamic pricing</li>
                    <li>Building SPAs or PWAs for online shopping using React and AEM</li>
                    <li>Personalized merchandising using Experience Fragments + product data</li>
                    <li>Global multi-site commerce deployment using AEM + CIF</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>AEM Commerce Architecture</h2>
                <h3>Overview of AEM-CIF (Commerce Integration Framework)</h3>
                <p>AEM CIF is Adobe's framework for integrating commerce systems into AEM Sites. It provides a standardized, extensible way to expose product data, carts, categories, and checkout functionality.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built-in GraphQL APIs to communicate with Adobe Commerce or other commerce engines</li>
                    <li>Pre-built commerce components (product teasers, carousels, PDPs, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Support for product browsing, filtering, search, and variants</li>
                    <li>Compatible with AEM Sites (on-premise or Cloud Service)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Role of CIF Add-ons and Magento/3rd Party Connectors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CIF Add-ons:</strong> Adobe-provided add-ons that install CIF core libraries, GraphQL client support, and commerce console UI into your AEM instance</li>
                    <li><strong>Magento Integration:</strong> CIF includes ready-made GraphQL connectors to integrate with Adobe Commerce (Magento 2), enabling real-time product data, cart, and order sync</li>
                    <li><strong>3rd Party Commerce Engines:</strong> CIF can be extended to connect with SAP Commerce, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, commercetools, and others via custom GraphQL or REST clients</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This architecture separates AEM as the content layer from the commerce engine, giving you flexibility in choosing or switching platforms.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Supported Commerce Backends</h2>
                <h3>Adobe Commerce (Magento)</h3>
                <p>Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento) is the primary backend supported out-of-the-box by AEM CIF. Integration is based on GraphQL APIs exposed by Magento, and CIF offers pre-built components and connectors to quickly integrate product data, carts, pricing, and more.</p>
                <h3>External Systems via GraphQL or REST</h3>
                <p>AEM CIF is backend-agnostic. You can integrate with any commerce engine that supports GraphQL or REST APIs, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>commercetools</li>
                    <li>SAP Commerce Cloud (Hybris)</li>
                    <li>Salesforce Commerce</li>
                    <li>Custom-built commerce solutions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Custom GraphQL clients can be developed to map AEM CIF core components to your API structure.</p>
                <h3>Sample CIF Reference Implementation</h3>
                <p>Adobe provides a CIF Reference Site that demonstrates all CIF components, templates, and integrations in action. This reference site is great for developers to understand how to build a full-fledged commerce experience in AEM.</p>

                </ul>
                <h3>Enabling the CIF Core Components</h3>
                <p>After installing, enable CIF components in your editable templates and configure the commerce endpoint via the AEM Tools console:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <code>Tools &gt; Cloud Services &gt; Commerce</code></li>
                    <li>Create a new <strong>Commerce Endpoint</strong> configuration pointing to your backend (Magento or other)</li>
                    <li>Assign the configuration to your site's root page or template</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now CIF components like product carousel, PDP, and category listing can be used in your pages.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>GraphQL Integration with Commerce</h2>
                <h3>Adobe Commerce GraphQL Endpoint</h3>
                <p>Magento (Adobe Commerce) exposes a robust GraphQL API at:</p>
                <pre>https://<your-magento-site>/graphql</pre>
                <p>This API allows querying products, categories, cart, checkout, and more.</p>
                <h3>Sample GraphQL Query to Fetch Product Data</h3>
                <p>Example query to retrieve basic product details:</p>
                <pre>
query {
  products(filter: { sku: { eq: "24-MB01" } }) {
    items {
      name
      sku
      price {
        regularPrice {
          amount {
            value
            currency
          }
        }
      }
      description {
        html
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
                <h3>Customizing GraphQL Queries</h3>
                <p>You can customize queries to fetch additional attributes, such as images, variants, reviews, and inventory. CIF components can also be extended to support custom fields returned from your commerce backend.</p>
                <p>For performance and security, AEM supports <strong>Persisted GraphQL Queries</strong>, which are stored server-side and referenced via aliases in frontend code.</p>
                <p>You can use tools like <a href="https://altair.sirmuel.design/" target="_blank">Altair</a> or <a href="https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql" target="_blank">GraphQL Playground</a> to test and build queries.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Routing and URL Mapping</h2>
                <p>AEM Commerce uses URL mapping and Sling resolution to dynamically render product detail pages (PDPs) based on product SKUs or category paths.</p>
                <h3>How AEM Resolves <code>/products/{sku}</code> URLs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>AEM uses Sling resource resolution and URL mapping to extract the product SKU from the request URL.</li>
                    <li>The CIF URL handler service intercepts requests like <code>/products/ABC123</code> and maps them to a generic PDP template.</li>
                    <li>The SKU is passed as a parameter to the component, which then queries Adobe Commerce via GraphQL to fetch product data.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Product Page Templates and URL Resolvers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can configure Sling mappings in <code>/etc/map</code> or use the CIF URL Resolver OSGi service.</li>
                    <li>Templates for product pages (e.g., PDPs) are created once and reused dynamically with different product SKUs.</li>
                    <li>Supports SEO-friendly URLs like <code>/products/shoes/sneakers/abc123</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Extending CIF Components</h2>
                <p>The CIF Core Components are built using Sling Models and HTL and can be extended like any other AEM component.</p>
                <h3>Using Sling Models and Resource Mappings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each CIF component is backed by a Sling Model that adapts from the AEM resource and injects product data.</li>
                    <li>You can extend the model to include additional logic, such as custom pricing, promotions, or inventory rules.</li>
                    <li>Use <code>/apps</code> overlays to customize dialogs or templates.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Custom GraphQL Bindings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can define custom GraphQL queries or use persisted queries to fetch additional attributes or relationships.</li>
                    <li>Bind the result of the query to a Sling Model and expose it to the frontend via HTL.</li>
                    <li>Ideal for integrating related products, cross-sells, or review data.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Styling & Layout Customization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>CIF components are frontend-framework agnostic and can be styled using standard CSS or SASS pipelines.</li>
                    <li>Design dialogs allow marketers to control layout variants (e.g., grid, list, large image).</li>
                    <li>You can integrate them with your site's design system or theme.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>AEM Commerce with SPA</h2>
                <p>You can build full headless e-commerce sites using AEM and Single Page Applications (SPAs) written in React or Vue.js.</p>
                <h3>Headless Commerce using React/Vue</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build SPAs using the AEM SPA Editor framework, allowing authors to drag-and-drop CIF components in editable pages.</li>
                    <li>SPAs communicate with Adobe Commerce via GraphQL for real-time product data, pricing, and inventory.</li>
                    <li>This approach offers faster performance, dynamic UI, and seamless personalization.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Example: Product Grid Rendered via GraphQL</h3>
                <pre>
query {
  products(filter: { category_uid: { eq: "12" } }) {
    items {
      name
      sku
      url_key
      image {
        url
      }
      price_range {
        minimum_price {
          regular_price {

            currency
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
                <p>The returned JSON data can be rendered in a grid/list format using frontend components in React or Vue.</p>
                <h3>Integration with AEM SPA Editor</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the AEM SPA SDK to bind frontend components with AEM JSON model output and GraphQL data.</li>
                    <li>Supports authoring experience via editable templates and real-time preview.</li>
                    <li>Allows deep integration with AEM workflows, targeting, and analytics.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="card">
                <h2>Performance & Caching</h2>
                <p>Optimizing performance is critical in AEM Commerce setups, especially when working with dynamic product data fetched via APIs.</p>
                <h3>Dispatcher Considerations for Commerce Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commerce data like PDPs, category pages, and product teasers can be cached if the product data doesn't change frequently.</li>
                    <li>For stock levels or pricing, it's recommended to fetch data live unless caching is explicitly safe.</li>
                    <li>Use caching headers and Dispatcher rules to control what is cached and for how long.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>When to Cache vs. When to Fetch Live</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cache static elements:</strong> banners, product descriptions, metadata, product images, and layout.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fetch live data:</strong> inventory, dynamic pricing, promotional offers, or customer-specific pricing.</li>
                    <li>Consider hybrid approaches using Edge Side Includes (ESI) or client-side rendering for dynamic elements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Security & API Access</h2>
                <p>Securing communication between AEM and Adobe Commerce (or third-party backends) is essential to protect sensitive business and customer data.</p>
                <h3>Secure API Calls to Adobe Commerce</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use HTTPS and secure firewalls for all commerce API endpoints.</li>
                    <li>Restrict public GraphQL access by enforcing access rules or whitelisting IPs.</li>
                    <li>Leverage persisted GraphQL queries to prevent exposure of raw API calls.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Authentication Strategies (OAuth, Tokens)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use OAuth 2.0 or token-based authentication for secure communication between AEM and Adobe Commerce.</li>
                    <li>Rotate API tokens periodically and manage them securely in environment variables or OSGi configs.</li>
                    <li>For third-party commerce platforms, use their supported secure authentication methods (e.g., JWT, Basic Auth).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use Catalog Models properly:</strong> Ensure content fragment or CIF models align with the structure of your product catalog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't hardcode SKUs:</strong> Always use dynamic bindings and data-driven rendering to keep templates reusable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reuse Experience Fragments:</strong> Use XF-based banners, promos, or cross-sell sections across PDPs and category pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test GraphQL Performance:</strong> Optimize complex queries, limit nested fields, and leverage persisted queries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leverage SPA Editor:</strong> For full headless commerce experiences, integrate CIF components in editable React/Vue pages.</li>
                </ul>
