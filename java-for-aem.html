                <h4>How does garbage collection work in Java?</h4>
                <h4>You have three Java classes. Class A (with constructor printing "Class A"). Class B extends A (constructor prints "Class B"). Class C extends B (constructor prints "Class C"). If you run Class C, what will be the output?</h4>
