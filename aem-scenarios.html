                <h4>Vanity URLs are not working in the published environment — what could be the issue?</h4>
                <h4>Why is a custom component working on Author but not rendering on Publish?</h4>
                <h4>You deployed a new template, but it's not visible to authors — what's missing?</h4>
                <h4>How to avoid cache issues when multiple authors publish simultaneously?</h4>

                <h4>You changed a clientlib but it's not updating in browser — what could be wrong?</h4>
                <h4>Why is a servlet under /bin path getting blocked in Dispatcher?</h4>
                <h4>What precautions should be taken while writing code under /apps or /libs?</h4>
                <h4>You created a new OSGi config but it's not visible in Felix Console — what could be wrong?</h4>

                <h4>Why is a page not editable even though you have modify permissions?</h4>
                <h4>You have a banner component with 10 fields. On Template A, only 5 of those fields should be visible, while on Template B, all 10 fields should appear. How would you implement this logic in AEM?</h4>
                <h4>You are using the Core Title component. The requirement is: if no title is authored in the dialog, it should fallback and display the current page title automatically. How can you achieve this behavior using Sling Models?</h4>

                <h4>In an AEM 6.5 project structure using Maven Archetype, we have folders like core, ui.apps, and ui.frontend. Can you explain how the CSS and JS from ui.frontend are linked or deployed to the components inside ui.apps?</h4>
                <h4>Your author instance is crashing intermittently during peak business hours. How would you approach identifying and fixing the issue?</h4>

                <h4>Your frontend team complains that GraphQL queries from Content Fragments are slow. What could be the reasons and how do you solve it?</h4>
                <h4>Authors report that uploading assets into DAM is very slow. What might be causing it?</h4>
