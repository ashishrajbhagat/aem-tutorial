                <h2>What is Adobe Experience Manager?</h2>
                <p>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is a comprehensive content management solution for building websites, mobile apps, and forms. It is part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud and provides tools for managing and delivering digital experiences across various channels.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>How AEM is different from other CMS platforms?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Integration with Adobe Ecosystem - </strong>AEM seamlessly integrates with other Adobe tools like Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign, enabling powerful marketing and personalization capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Fragments and Experience Fragments - </strong>AEM offers modular content creation through Content Fragments and Experience Fragments, allowing content reuse across various channels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Asset Management (DAM) - </strong>Unlike many CMS platforms, AEM includes a robust DAM system to manage and organize digital assets effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Scalability - </strong>AEM as a Cloud Service provides auto-scaling, continuous updates, and reduced infrastructure management compared to traditional CMS platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Site and Multi-Language Support - </strong>With tools like Multi-Site Manager (MSM) and language copy, AEM simplifies the management of global and multilingual websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable Workflows - </strong>AEM enables the creation of tailored workflows for content approval, publishing, and other business processes.</li>
