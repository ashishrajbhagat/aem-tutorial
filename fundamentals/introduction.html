                <h2>What is Adobe Experience Manager?</h2>
                <p>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is a comprehensive content management system (CMS) and digital experience platform designed to help businesses create, manage, and optimize digital content across multiple channels. It enables organizations to deliver personalized and engaging experiences to users through websites, mobile apps, and other digital touchpoints. AEM integrates powerful tools for content authoring, asset management, and workflow automation, making it easier for teams to collaborate efficiently. With features like headless CMS capabilities, cloud scalability, and AI-powered automation, AEM is widely used by enterprises to enhance customer engagement, improve operational efficiency, and drive digital transformation.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>How AEM is different from other CMS platforms?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Integration with Adobe Ecosystem - </strong>AEM seamlessly integrates with other Adobe tools like Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign, enabling powerful marketing and personalization capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Fragments and Experience Fragments - </strong>AEM offers modular content creation through Content Fragments and Experience Fragments, allowing content reuse across various channels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Asset Management (DAM) - </strong>Unlike many CMS platforms, AEM includes a robust DAM system to manage and organize digital assets effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Scalability - </strong>AEM as a Cloud Service provides auto-scaling, continuous updates, and reduced infrastructure management compared to traditional CMS platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Site and Multi-Language Support - </strong>With tools like Multi-Site Manager (MSM) and language copy, AEM simplifies the management of global and multilingual websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable Workflows - </strong>AEM enables the creation of tailored workflows for content approval, publishing, and other business processes.</li>

                <h2>Author & Publish Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) uses a decoupled architecture based on Author and Publish instances to separate content creation from content delivery. This setup enhances security, scalability, and performance while enabling collaboration among authors and a smooth publishing workflow.
                </p>
                <h3>What is an Author Instance?</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Author instance</strong> is the backend environment where content authors create and manage websites, assets, templates, workflows, and configurations.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used by authors, admins, and marketers.</li>
                    <li>Secure internal access only (behind firewall/VPN).</li>
                    <li>Supports workflows, versioning, approvals, and testing.</li>
                    <li>URL Example: <code>http://localhost:4502</code></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What is a Publish Instance?</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Publish instance</strong> is the frontend environment that serves published content to end users. It contains only approved and activated content from the Author instance.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public-facing environment (behind Dispatcher).</li>
                    <li>No authoring tools or content creation UI.</li>
                    <li>Used for final content delivery to users.</li>
                    <li>URL Example: <code>http://localhost:4503</code></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How Replication Works</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Replication</strong> is the mechanism to publish content from Author to Publish. It can be triggered manually, via workflow, or automatically using launchers.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replication agents handle the transport of content.</li>
                    <li>Uses queues to ensure content is delivered correctly.</li>
                    <li>Also supports reverse replication (from Publish to Author, e.g., for form data).</li>
                    <li>Includes content pages, assets, code packages, and configurations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Dispatcher: Role in AEM Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Dispatcher</strong> is Adobe's caching and load balancing tool that sits in front of the Publish instance. It enhances performance and security.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Caches static content (HTML, JS, CSS, images).</li>
                    <li>Protects Publish instance from direct access.</li>
                    <li>Can load balance multiple Publish instances.</li>
                    <li>Applies filter rules for access control.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Preview vs Live Environments</h3>
                <p>
                    Many AEM projects include a <strong>Preview</strong> Publish instance to allow content authors and QA teams to review content before it goes live.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preview = Internal content testing (non-public).</li>
                    <li>Live = Final content delivery to public users.</li>
                    <li>Helps validate content and personalization.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Multi-Publish and Failover Support</h3>
                <p>
                    Enterprise-grade AEM setups often use multiple Publish instances to ensure high availability and scalability.

                <ul>
                    <li>Dispatcher load balances requests among multiple Publish instances.</li>
                    <li>If one Publish server fails, others continue serving content.</li>
                    <li>Ideal for global websites and high-traffic apps.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Benefits of Author-Publish Architecture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improves scalability by separating concerns.</li>
                    <li>Enhances security with isolated authoring.</li>
                    <li>Increases performance through caching.</li>
                    <li>Enables collaborative, workflow-driven content creation.</li>

                <h2>AEM Architecture Stack</h2>
                <p>The architecture stack of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is based on several key open-source technologies. Three of the most important components are <code>Apache Felix</code>, <code>Apache Jackrabbit</code>, and <code>Apache Sling</code>. These technologies work together to provide the foundational framework for AEM.</p>
