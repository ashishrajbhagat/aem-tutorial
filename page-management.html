            <h1>Page Management</h1>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Page Creation, Move, Copy & Delete</h2>
                <p>AEM provides a seamless interface for managing pages within the Sites console. Authors and admins can create new pages, reorganize content structures, and remove unnecessary pages.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create:</strong> In the Sites console, select a location and click <em>Create ‚Üí Page</em>. Choose a template and fill in page details like title and name.</li>
                    <li><strong>Move:</strong> Select a page and choose <em>Move</em> to relocate it. AEM updates all internal references automatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Copy:</strong> Use the <em>Copy</em> and <em>Paste</em> options to duplicate a page, including its child pages and content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Select the page and choose <em>Delete</em>. AEM will ask for confirmation, especially if references exist.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These operations are permission-based, ensuring only authorized users can modify site structure.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Versioning</h2>
                <p>AEM supports version control for all pages. This helps teams track changes, restore older versions, and maintain content integrity over time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Creating a Version:</strong> In the page editor, click <em>Page Info ‚Üí Create Version</em>. Add a version label and comment for tracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Viewing Versions:</strong> Go to the <em>Timeline</em> and filter for version entries. You can see all previously saved versions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Restoring a Version:</strong> Choose a version and click <em>Revert</em> to restore that content snapshot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Versioning is crucial for audit trails, content rollback, and QA validations before publishing changes.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Timeline</h2>
                <p>The Timeline view in the Sites console provides a chronological record of changes for a selected page or folder. It's especially helpful for tracking actions over time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What It Shows:</strong> Version creation, publishing, workflow events, comments, and page locks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Select a page and click the clock icon <em>(Timeline)</em> in the toolbar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Commenting:</strong> Team members can add comments to the timeline for collaborative documentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This tool enables transparency in content management and helps resolve issues by reviewing recent activity.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Page Locking and Unlocking</h2>
                <p>Page locking ensures content integrity by preventing multiple authors from editing the same page simultaneously.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Locking:</strong> A page is locked automatically when an author opens it in the editor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manual Locking:</strong> Can be set from the Sites console to prevent unauthorized edits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unlocking:</strong> Only the locking user or an admin can unlock a page. This is done via the Page Info dropdown.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Locking is vital in collaborative environments to avoid overwriting changes or introducing merge conflicts.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Reference Panel</h2>
                <p>The References panel in AEM shows all relationships and dependencies associated with a page. It helps authors understand how content is reused or linked.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accessing:</strong> In the Sites console, select a page and click the <em>References</em> icon in the top bar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Includes:</strong> Language copies, live copies (MSM), experience fragments, content fragments, and referenced assets/components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Prevent deleting referenced content, manage translations, and identify reusable assets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This panel is essential for maintaining site integrity and avoiding accidental disruption of connected content.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Vanity URLs in AEM</h2>
                <p>A <strong>Vanity URL</strong> in AEM is a user-friendly, customizable URL path that maps to an internal content path. It allows marketers and content authors to create cleaner, shorter, and more memorable URLs for pages without changing the actual structure in the JCR.</p>
                <p>Normally, a page in AEM might be accessed via a long path like: <code>/content/mysite/en/products/product-a.html</code><br>With a vanity URL, you can access it via a cleaner path like: <code>/product-a</code></p>
                <h3>‚öôÔ∏è How to Set a Vanity URL</h3>
                <p>You can assign a vanity URL through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CRXDE:</strong> Open the page node (e.g., <code>/content/mysite/en/products/product-a</code>) and set the property:
                        <code>vanityPath = /product-a</code> (type: String or String[])
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Page Properties in Touch UI:</strong> Navigate to the page ‚Üí Click on <em>Page Properties</em> ‚Üí Go to the <em>Advanced</em> tab ‚Üí Enter the vanity URL.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>üîÅ Multiple Vanity URLs</h3>
                <p>You can set multiple vanity paths as an array by entering multiple values in CRXDE or Touch UI. Each will point to the same page.</p>
                <h3>‚ùå Things to Keep in Mind</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vanity URLs must be unique across the repository. If two pages define the same vanity path, AEM won't know which to resolve.</li>
                    <li>AEM doesn't auto-redirect from the full path to the vanity URL ‚Äî both are accessible unless you configure redirection separately.</li>
                    <li>Vanity URLs are only resolved via the <strong>Resource Resolver</strong> and need Dispatcher to be configured properly to allow them.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>üß† How AEM Resolves Vanity URLs</h3>
                <p>The <code>org.apache.sling.jcr.resource.internal.JcrResourceResolverFactoryImpl</code> service handles vanity URL resolution. Its key configuration properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enable Vanity Path:</strong> Whether to allow vanity resolution at all</li>
                    <li><strong>Vanity Path Bloom Filter:</strong> Used for performance optimization to cache available vanity paths</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximum Entries:</strong> How many entries to allow in the cache</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>üö´ Disabling Vanity Paths for Performance</h3>
                <p>In large repositories, you might disable vanity path resolution or limit it to improve performance using:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apache Sling Resource Resolver Factory</strong> ‚Üí <code>Enable Vanity Path = false</code></li>
                    <li>Use Dispatcher to explicitly deny vanity paths unless required</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>‚úÖ Best Practices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep vanity URLs short, meaningful, and consistent with your site's brand</li>
                    <li>Regularly audit vanity paths to avoid conflicts or outdated mappings</li>
                    <li>Avoid using vanity URLs for internal-only pages or system pages</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>üîç Troubleshooting: Pages Not Visible in Author</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check Permissions:</strong> The logged-in user might not have 'jcr:read' access on the page path. Use <code>useradmin</code> or the CRXDE to validate ACLs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check Page Filters:</strong> The Sites Console may have filters (e.g., by name, template, modified date). Clear filters and try again.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check Blueprint/Rollout Config:</strong> If using MSM (Multi-Site Manager), rollout config issues may prevent visibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check for Deleted or Deactivated Pages:</strong> Pages that have been deactivated (unpublished) might still exist in Author but may be hidden due to filter settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check if Page was Moved or Renamed:</strong> Use CRXDE to look for the page under its expected path. You might be searching in the wrong location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replication Status:</strong> Ensure pages weren't replicated without proper approval (check Replication tab in Page Properties).</li>
                    <li><strong>Check for Workspace Corruption:</strong> Rarely, inconsistencies in JCR may cause indexing issues. Restart or reindex if needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use CRXDE Lite (<code>/crx/de</code>) to search for the page path directly and validate its node structure.</p>
