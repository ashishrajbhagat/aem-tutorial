            <h1>Apache Jackrabbit (JCR Implementation)</h1>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Apache Jackrabbit is an open-source implementation of the Java Content Repository (JCR) specification. It serves as the backbone for content storage in AEM.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apache Jackrabbit is a fully compliant implementation of JCR (JSR-170 and JSR-283).</li>
                    <li>It provides a hierarchical content repository with powerful storage and search capabilities.</li>
                    <li>Used as the default persistence layer in AEM for managing structured and unstructured content.</li>
                    <li>Jackrabbit allows the storage of structured and unstructured content and provides features like versioning, access control, and content queries.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Role in AEM</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Content Storage: </strong>Apache Jackrabbit is responsible for storing all the content in AEM, whether itâ€™s structured data (e.g., page content) or unstructured data (e.g., images, videos).</li>
                    <li><strong>JCR API: </strong>AEM interacts with Jackrabbit using the JCR API, which allows developers to interact with content in a standardized way. This API includes functionality for CRUD operations, versioning, and querying content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Versioning and Locking: </strong>Jackrabbit provides version control for content, meaning AEM can keep track of content changes over time and roll back to previous versions if necessary. It also allows locking of content nodes to prevent concurrent updates from conflicting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Querying: </strong>Jackrabbit supports querying content using JCR-SQL2 or XPath query languages, which allows developers to search and retrieve content stored in the repository efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Difference Between JCR and a Traditional Database</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JCR</strong> stores content in a hierarchical tree structure (nodes and properties) while <strong>Traditional Database</strong> uses relational tables and rows.</li>
                    <li><strong>JCR</strong> supports full-text search, versioning, and access control out-of-the-box while <strong>Traditional Database</strong> requires manual implementation for versioning and permissions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Content Storage: </strong>Jackrabbit stores content in a tree structure, making it easy to organize and manage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full-Text Search:</strong> Supports indexing and powerful queries with Apache Lucene.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Versioning: </strong>Provides built-in version control, enabling content rollback and auditability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Standardized API: </strong>The JCR API provides a uniform way to interact with content, which can be used across different implementations of JCR.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Querying: </strong>Jackrabbit's powerful querying features allow for efficient search and retrieval of content.</li>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>JCR Repository Architecture</h2>
                <p>The JCR repository in AEM provides a flexible and scalable way to store content in a hierarchical manner. It is structured with different components such as repository, workspace, and nodes that manage and store content.</p>
                <h3>Repository, Workspace, and Node Structure</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Repository:</strong> The entire JCR content store, which includes all workspaces, nodes, and properties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Workspace:</strong> A container for content, providing an isolated environment to manage content. Each workspace is like a separate repository.</li>
                    <li><strong>Node Structure:</strong> Content in JCR is stored as a tree structure with nodes representing content and properties representing data.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Hierarchical Content Storage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content is stored in a tree-like structure (nodes and sub-nodes), similar to a file system.</li>
                    <li>Each node can have multiple child nodes and properties, making it flexible and scalable.</li>
                    <li>The structure allows for efficient management and retrieval of content at various levels.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>JCR Node Types and Properties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Node Types:</strong> Define the structure and properties a node can have. Common types include <code>nt:unstructured</code>, <code>nt:file</code>, and <code>nt:folder</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Nodes can have properties that hold data such as text, numbers, dates, or references to other nodes.</li>
                    <li>Node types ensure consistency and provide a way to define and enforce how content is structured.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Session and Access Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Session:</strong> Represents a user's interaction with the repository. Each session can interact with content, create nodes, and modify data within the scope of the workspace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Controls the permissions for accessing and modifying nodes. Can be configured at a granular level to ensure content security.</li>
                    <li>Access control lists (ACLs) are used to specify which users or groups have read/write access to certain parts of the repository.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>JCR Querying and Searching</h2>
                <p>JCR provides powerful querying capabilities to search and retrieve content stored in the repository. You can query the repository using different query languages such as SQL2, XPath, and JCR-SQL.</p>
                <h3>Querying with SQL2</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL2:</strong> A query language similar to SQL, designed for querying JCR repositories.</li>
                    <li>Allows for complex queries and sorting of results, much like SQL, but optimized for hierarchical content structures.</li>
                    <li>Supports <strong>full-text search</strong>, <strong>ordering</strong>, and <strong>filtering</strong> of nodes based on their properties.</li>
                    <li>
                        Example query:
                        <pre>SELECT * FROM [nt:base] WHERE [jcr:primaryType] = 'cq:Page'</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Querying with XPath</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>XPath:</strong> A query language for navigating XML documents, used in JCR for querying content using XPath expressions.</li>
                    <li>XPath allows for selecting nodes based on their names, types, and attributes.</li>
                    <li>Commonly used when working with <strong>JCR node paths</strong> and for querying content in a more flexible manner.</li>
                    <li>
                        Example query:
                        <pre>//element(*, cq:Page)[@jcr:primaryType = 'cq:Page']</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Querying with JCR-SQL</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JCR-SQL:</strong> A simple SQL-like query language, but specifically tailored for querying JCR nodes and properties.</li>
                    <li>Provides a lightweight alternative to SQL2 and XPath for simpler queries on the repository.</li>
                    <li>
                        Example query:
                        <pre>SELECT * FROM cq:Page WHERE jcr:primaryType = 'cq:Page'</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Using QueryManager and QueryResult</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>QueryManager:</strong> The API used to create and execute queries in JCR. It provides methods to execute different query types like SQL2, XPath, and JCR-SQL.</li>
                    <li><strong>QueryResult:</strong> Represents the results of a query. It provides methods to iterate over results and access nodes and their properties.</li>
                    <li>
                        Example usage:
                        <pre>
QueryManager queryManager = session.getWorkspace().getQueryManager();
Query query = queryManager.createQuery("SELECT * FROM [nt:base]", Query.JCR_SQL2);
QueryResult result = query.execute();</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Node Operations in JCR</h2>
                <p>JCR provides a set of operations to interact with nodes and properties stored in the content repository. These operations include creating, reading, updating, and deleting nodes (CRUD operations), as well as managing node types and properties.</p>
                <h3>Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting Nodes (CRUD Operations)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Creating Nodes:</strong> New nodes can be created by using the <code>node.addNode()</code> method, where you define the node name and type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reading Nodes:</strong> Existing nodes are retrieved using the <code>node.getNode()</code> or <code>node.getProperty()</code> methods to access node data and properties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Updating Nodes:</strong> Nodes or their properties can be updated using methods like <code>node.setProperty()</code> or <code>node.setNode()</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deleting Nodes:</strong> Nodes can be deleted with the <code>node.remove()</code> method, ensuring that all related properties and child nodes are also deleted.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Understanding Node Types (nt:unstructured, nt:folder, nt:file, etc.)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>nt:unstructured:</strong> A generic node type used for storing arbitrary content. It is flexible and can be used for various types of data.</li>
                    <li><strong>nt:folder:</strong> Used for hierarchical storage, typically representing directories or folder structures in the repository.</li>
                    <li><strong>nt:file:</strong> Represents file-based content, such as images, documents, and other binary files. It typically contains properties like <code>jcr:data</code> for binary data.</li>
                    <li><strong>nt:resource:</strong> Used for content storage that is not based on traditional file structures, often used for AEM resources.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Property Storage and Retrieval</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Property Storage:</strong> Each node can have properties that store data. Properties can be simple values (strings, integers, dates) or complex (binary data, references to other nodes).</li>
                    <li><strong>Retrieving Properties:</strong> Properties can be accessed using <code>node.getProperty()</code>. For example, <code>node.getProperty("jcr:title").getString()</code> retrieves the title property of a node.</li>
                    <li><strong>Updating Properties:</strong> You can update properties using <code>node.setProperty()</code>. For instance, <code>node.setProperty("jcr:title", "New Title")</code> modifies the title property.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Versioning in JCR</h2>
                <p>Versioning in JCR allows you to store and manage different versions of content nodes, which helps to track changes over time and roll back to previous states if necessary.</p>
                <h3>What is JCR Versioning?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JCR Versioning:</strong> A mechanism for tracking the history of content nodes in the repository, allowing content authors to store multiple versions of a node.</li>
                    <li>Each version of a node represents the state of the content at a given point in time, making it easier to revert to a previous version if needed.</li>
                    <li>Versioning is essential for content management workflows and auditing purposes, ensuring content integrity and security.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Enabling Versioning for a Node</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enable Versioning:</strong> Versioning is enabled by setting the <code>mix:versionable</code> mixin on a node, which allows the node to be versioned.</li>
                    <li>
                        To enable versioning, use the following command:
                        <pre>node.addMixin("mix:versionable");</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once enabled, a version history will be maintained, and the node can have multiple versions created and stored automatically.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Retrieving Previous Versions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accessing Version History:</strong> The version history of a node can be accessed using the <code>Node.getVersionHistory()</code> method.</li>
                    <li>Each version can be retrieved using the <code>VersionHistory.getVersion()</code> method, which returns a specific version of the node.</li>
                    <li>
                        Example to retrieve the previous version:
                        <pre>
VersionHistory versionHistory = node.getVersionHistory();
Version version = versionHistory.getVersion("1.0");</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reverting to a Previous Version:</strong> A node can be reverted to a specific version by using the <code>node.restore()</code> method.</li>
                </ul>
