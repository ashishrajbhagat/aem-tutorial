                <h2>Pipelines in Cloud Manager</h2>
                <p>Pipelines in Cloud Manager orchestrate the automated flow of building, validating, and deploying code into AEM cloud environments. There are different types of pipelines based on the target environment and control levels.</p>
                <h3>Types of Pipelines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-Production Pipeline:</strong> Used for development and stage environments. These pipelines deploy automatically without manual approvals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Production Pipeline:</strong> Includes additional quality gates and a mandatory manual approval step before deploying to production.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>CI/CD Workflow in Cloud Manager</h3>
                <p>Each pipeline includes a series of automated steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Code Build:</strong> Compiles and packages code using Adobe's Cloud SDK and Maven tooling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code Quality:</strong> Performs static analysis using Adobe-defined rules (e.g., code smells, maintainability).</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Scans:</strong> Scans for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Runs automated tests in a stage environment to simulate traffic and measure performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deploys code to the designated AEM environment (with optional manual approval).</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Custom Pipeline Variables and Configuration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define environment variables, secrets, and flags for custom behaviors.</li>
                    <li>Set up filters to trigger deployments only for specific branches or projects.</li>
                    <li>Use advanced pipeline YAML templates (if supported by Adobe) to control execution logic.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Environments</h2>
                <p>In AEM as a Cloud Service, environments represent isolated instances of AEM used for different stages of the development lifecycle. These include development, staging, and production environments, all managed through Cloud Manager.</p>
                <h3>Default AEMaaCS Environments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Development:</strong> Used by developers to test features, integrations, and content workflows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage:</strong> Mirrors production; used for UAT, performance testing, and release validation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Production:</strong> The live customer-facing environment. Requires strict control and approval for deployments.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Managing Environments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Environments are provisioned by Adobe based on your license and onboarding plan.</li>
                    <li>You can view and manage environments via the Cloud Manager UI under the ‚ÄúEnvironments‚Äù tab.</li>
                    <li>Each environment is linked with its own code deployment pipeline.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Environment-Specific Configuration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use OSGi runmodes like <code>dev</code>, <code>stage</code>, and <code>prod</code> to manage environment-specific configs.</li>
                    <li>
                        Place environment configs in folders like:
                        <pre>/apps/myproject/config.dev
/apps/myproject/config.stage
/apps/myproject/config.prod</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Secrets, endpoints, and feature flags should be scoped per environment for safety.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Code Quality and Static Analysis</h2>
                <p>Cloud Manager enforces code quality through automated static analysis during the build process. This helps prevent issues from reaching production and ensures adherence to Adobe's AEM best practices.</p>
                <h3>What Is Checked</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Ensures clean, maintainable code (e.g., unused variables, cyclomatic complexity).</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Checks for vulnerabilities in custom code and third-party libraries (e.g., CVEs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Warns against performance bottlenecks like synchronous resource calls or inefficient queries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Validates common AEM patterns like resource resolution, service injection, and configuration management.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Quality Gates</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each code scan is scored (0-100) and compared against thresholds.</li>
                    <li>Failing a quality gate (e.g., below 60) stops deployment to stage or production.</li>
                    <li>Thresholds and scoring logic are based on Adobe's internal rule sets.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Suppressions and Customization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can suppress certain rules using inline comments or configuration files, if justified.</li>
                    <li>Custom rules can't be added directly, but code should be adjusted to conform to Cloud Manager's standards.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reporting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Static analysis reports are downloadable from the Cloud Manager pipeline execution screen.</li>
                    <li>Developers can review the rule breakdown, score summary, and file-level issues.</li>
                    <li>Helps track technical debt over time.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Performance Testing</h2>
                <p>Cloud Manager includes built-in performance testing as part of the production pipeline to ensure that code changes do not negatively impact the stability and speed of the AEM site under load.</p>
                <h3>Purpose of Performance Testing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simulate real-world load conditions on the staging environment.</li>
                    <li>Measure key performance indicators (KPIs) before deployment.</li>
                    <li>Catch issues like slow response times or memory spikes early.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Performance Metrics Captured</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Response Time:</strong> Average and peak times during load simulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Rate:</strong> Number of failed requests or exceptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> Requests per second the system can handle.</li>
                    <li><strong>CPU/Memory Usage:</strong> System resource utilization during test run.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatically runs during the stage deployment phase of the production pipeline.</li>
                    <li>Load tests simulate anonymous and logged-in user traffic patterns.</li>
                    <li>Results determine whether the pipeline proceeds or fails.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Thresholds and Failures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If thresholds are breached (e.g., high error rate), deployment to production is blocked.</li>
                    <li>Detailed test reports are available in the pipeline logs for investigation.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Deployment Approval</h2>
                <p>For production environments, Cloud Manager enforces a manual approval step after successful code validation and testing. This ensures human oversight before live deployment.</p>
                <h3>Manual Approval Workflow</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once a production pipeline passes all quality gates, performance tests, and validations, it pauses for approval.</li>
                    <li>Designated users must log in to Cloud Manager to approve or reject the deployment.</li>
                    <li>Approval must occur within a specific time window or the pipeline expires.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Who Can Approve?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roles like <strong>Business Owner</strong> or <strong>Program Manager</strong> have access to the approval step.</li>
                    <li>Roles are assigned via the Adobe Admin Console.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Deployment Freeze and Governance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloud Manager allows defining blackout periods during which deployments are blocked.</li>
                    <li>Helps align with business release calendars and compliance requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Best Practices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always review test results and static analysis before approving.</li>
                    <li>Notify stakeholders when a deployment is about to go live.</li>
                    <li>Ensure rollback plan is in place in case of post-deployment issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <h2>Access and Permissions</h2>
